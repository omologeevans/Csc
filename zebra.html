    <h1>Zebra</h1>
    <p>Zebras are known for their black and white striped coats, which serve as effective camouflage against predators such as lions and hyenas. Three species of zebras exist: plains zebras, mountain zebras, and Grevy's zebras.</p>
    <p>They are herbivores, grazing on grasses in African grasslands, and often gather in groups for protection.</p>
