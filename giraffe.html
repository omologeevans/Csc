    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, reaching heights of up to 18 feet. They possess long necks and distinctive spotted coats, which help them blend into their native African savannas.</p>
    <p>Their prehensile tongues allow them to grasp and eat leaves from tall trees. Despite their imposing appearance, giraffes are gentle herbivores that typically form loose social groups.</p>
